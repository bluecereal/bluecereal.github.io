			Tired.  Played foosball(?) for the first time, whatever it's called.  Like soccer except the teams are small and you play inside, with a smaller ball and a smaller field.  I feel so much more normal after doing something exciting like that.  If I don't, I'm like a simmering ball of resentment and worry.

			The other day I got in a fight with my sister, like a physical altercation.  She's been skinning up in her room, which is fine, but she's been leaving her door open and not running a fan or anything.  It's been getting me high!  And I don't want to be high, not even a little bit.  I'm done with the good kush, it doesn't help me in the least.  Just makes things worse.  Anyway, I gave her a fan and asked her to close the door and run the fan when she's smoking in there or whatever.  She didn't do that, annoying, few days later I get yet another contact high.  So I took the fan back so that I could use it, and asked her to keep the door closed or something.  She can't do that either so I start closing it for her, the third time I do it she just comes at me like a really angry person would, clawing and kicking.  It kind of caught me off guard.  I punched her in the head a couple times.  Don't punch people in the head by the way, good way to break a bone in your arm wrist hand.  I think ideally I would have pinned her arms, or struck her in the stomach or something to disable her.  I handled it poorly, but I don't feel terrible about it, I defended myself.  I could have ran and hid behind a door, but I don't like that idea.  I could come up with all sorts of ideas as to why but mostly I didn't have time to get into that position.

			Anyway, I moved most of my stuff into the basement and I'm sleeping down here now.  If I was more mindful I think I would have seen this coming, like what else would you expect from someone hopped up on the amphetamine adjacent magical depression ADHD bipolar curing drug bupropion and weed cartridges, especially given the family we have grown up in.  The most important thing this interaction has made me realize is that not everything is my fault, and I can't blame myself for everything.  I'm not god, or the Buddha, or some hero here to save the minds and integrity of my family members.  My name is Harrison, I'm 26, I live here, I have wants, needs, wishes goals interests beliefs.  I care about my self, my I, and I want my self to be respected.  I want that for myself.  And that isn't going to happen here. I have to leave.  Should have left way sooner, when I was 18 and had fewer things accumulated here.  I'm worried that when I leave I'll be punished, that my mom will resent me for leaving and not allow me to come back, or my things will be throughtlessly thrown out without regard for what I want to do with those things.   IDK

			She also told me to kill myself, that my brain was broken from all the drugs I did (therefore it didn't matter that I was getting a contact high), that she was going to kill me, threw her vape at me, it was pretty crazy, sent me some apt listings for places that are supposed to be bad or slummy or something (they looked fine ig).  Also called me Buddha boy, I think she overheard me talking to my therapist at some point, maybe not idk.  Either way it isn't a very good insult, the Buddha was especially kind for what he did for us.  For closing her door.  Madness

			I don't have anything to write here yet.  I do but I don't feel like it.  That's not true either.  To be honest I have plenty of things to say, all the time, but I don't want to say them.  That's not true either, it isn't about wanting or not wanting; there's a resistance there, a fear of death.  If I go there, I will die.  But what's I, why is I afraid of death, is there death?  Is there fear?  Yes and no, thinking makes it so.  That's not entirely true either, it's true to an extent.  I think anything you can say is true to an extent, anything you feel is true to an extent, but that is not good enough for me and it shouldn't be good enough for you.  Like, how can you be satisfied with that?

			Some of us are lost.  Put another way, some of us are our way to being found.  When we are found, when we eventually (inevitably?) collide with the truth, we are stunned, maybe wrecked.  Like if you ran into a wall, truth that stopped us deformed in front of us.  Confused we stumble out of the wreckage, or maybe we simply blink our eyes in surprise. Either way, the message is the same.  "Welcome to the End, don't panic there is nothing to fear.  Energy never dies, energy cannot be destroyed.  What always is, always will be.  the Energy Never Dies (gotta get get, gotta get get, gotta get get, gotta get-get-get-get-get- Boom Boom boOm, gotta getget Boom Boom boOm, gotta getget Boom Boom boOm..."
