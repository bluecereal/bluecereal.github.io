			I don't have anything to write here yet.  I do but I don't feel like it.  That's not true either.  To be honest I have plenty of things to say, all the time, but I don't want to say them.  That's not true either, it isn't about wanting or not wanting; there's a resistance there, a fear of death.  If I go there, I will die.  But what's I, why is I afraid of death, is there death?  Is there fear?  Yes and no, thinking makes it so.  That's not entirely true either, it's true to an extent.  I think anything you can say is true to an extent, anything you feel is true to an extent, but that is not good enough for me and it shouldn't be good enough for you.  Like, how can you be satisfied with that?

			Some of us are lost.  Put another way, some of us are our way to being found.  When we are found, when we eventually (inevitably?) collide with the truth, we are stunned, maybe wrecked.  Like if you ran into a wall, truth that stopped us deformed in front of us.  Confused we stumble out of the wreckage, or maybe we simply blink our eyes in surprise. Either way, the message is the same.  "Welcome to the End, don't panic there is nothing to fear.  Energy never dies, energy cannot be destroyed.  What always is, always will be.  the Energy Never Dies (gotta get get, gotta get get, gotta get get, gotta get-get-get-get-get- Boom Boom boOm, gotta getget Boom Boom boOm, gotta getget Boom Boom boOm..."
